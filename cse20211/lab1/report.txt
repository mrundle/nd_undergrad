My program for the creative portion of Lab 1 (prog3) computes a popular equation in kinematics, vf=vi+a*t. 
From the user's perspective, the program outputs the final velocity of an object in motion after
the intial velocity, acceleration, and duration of movement are input. From a programmer's 
perspective, the program first declares all variables. Next, the program prompts the user to provide
values for certain variables. Using this information to plug into the equation, the program 
calculates the value for final velocity, and then displays it to the user. 

To evaluate the program for correctness, I ran through a few instances of choosing different sets
of numbers and then plugging them into the program. After attaining a result, I then checked the 
math by hand to make sure that the two matched up. When extremely small (or extremely large numbers) 
are used, however, the computer will return inaccurate results. For example, if you input the number
.0000001 for each variable, the computer will return 0.000000 for the final velocity. On the other end, 
extremely large numbers will also skew the accuracy a little bit, but the calculation can still be
performed. To counterbalance this issue, I made the program terminate if the user tried to use values
that were too small to make accurate calculations. For general purposes, however, I think that this 
program is very well suited for a general audience.
