Lab Report

	For the creative portion of this week's lab we were asked to design a sickening carnival ride. From a users standpoint, this program is relatively
simple; just start the program, view the motion of the carnival ride, and press 'q' to quit. For an added bonus, they can also use the + and - buttons 
to control the speed of the ride if they so choose.
	From a programmer's perspective, the inner workings of the program are relatively simple in the main function, but some careful thought was 
required in the drafting of the functions used their. There were four general moving "parts," that each depended on the other. First was the structure
itself, which slides back and forth horizontally. Next, there is a large bar that swings circularly (it is called a "pendulum" in the program) from a 
fixed point on top of the main structure. From the end of this pendulum bar is another bar that extends in both directions and twirls radially. At each 
end of this spinning bar are circular carts (where the riders are strapped in), which are spinning throughout the ride.  To coordinate all of these and 
make sure that everything is in the same place, the functions are written in a cascading style, where a general 'draw structure' function is called 
from the main function, which calls a function that adds the pendulum, which calls another function that adds the rotating bars, which calls a final 
function that draws the wheel carts. In this way, the positions and speeds of each component are interlinked.  
	Validating results was fairly easy in this particular case, because to check the code you simply had to open up the program and see if the 
correct animation was produced for a fair amount of time.
